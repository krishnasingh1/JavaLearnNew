/*
        if-else statement --> The if-else statement is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code, i.e.,
                              else block. The else block is executed if the condition of the if-block is evaluated as false.

                              Syntax:

                                    if(condition) {
                                    statement 1; //executes when condition is true
                                    }
                                    else{
                                    statement 2; //executes when condition is false
                                    }
