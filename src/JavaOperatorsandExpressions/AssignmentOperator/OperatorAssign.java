/*
        (=) operator --> This is the most straightforward assignment operator, which is used to
                         assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. This is the
                         basic definition of an assignment operator and how it functions.

                         Syntax:

                        num1 = num2;
                        Example:

                        a = 10;
                        ch = 'y';
